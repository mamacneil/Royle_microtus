Example 6.4 from Royle and Dorazio (2008) pp. 215-219

This example shows a PyMC implementation of Royle and Dorazio's individual heterogeniety model for Jim Nichols' meadow vole dataset. The model is of general interest as an illustration of data-augmentation for mark-recapture data that includes imputation of individual covariates, in this case the mass of the unobserved voles.
